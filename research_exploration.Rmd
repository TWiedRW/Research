# Research Topics

- Perception of 3D printed graphs

- Create extension of `ggplot2`

- Recreate old census graphics

- Perception of map projections

# Perception of 3D Printed Graphs

[Tactile Heatmaps: A Novel Visualisation Technique for Data Analysis with Tactile Charts](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3453892.3458045)

- Pilot study (11 participants)

- Participants preferred 3D printed heatmaps over alternative material/plots

- Elevation and texture combinations were suggested

- Metrics about preference instead of error metrics

[User Study: A Detailed View on the Effectiveness and Design of Tactile Charts](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-29381-9_5)

- Larger study (37 participants)

- Bar chart, line chart, scatter plots

- Readability and accuracy

[ Data Visualization: Preference and Use of Two-Dimensional and Three-Dimensional Graphs](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/089443939701500303)

- No preference of visual appeal for 2D vs. 3D charts, with exceptions 

- Participants liked 3D mixed bar and line graphs, but disliked 3D floating line graphs

- 2D more effective at conveying quantitative data than 3D on paper

[The effects of two- or three-dimensional graphics on the problem-solving performance of experienced and novice decision makers](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01449298908914567)

- Has page of previous study results

    - raw data vs statistically summarized reports
    
    - tabular display vs. 2D graphs
    
    - CRT displayed information vs. teletype terminals; graphs vs tabular reports
    
    - tabular displays vs. 2D graphs
    
    - 3D graphs vs tabular presentations of data
    
    - 2D tables and graphs vs. either alone
    
    - tabular displays vs. 2D graphs
    
    - 2D graphs vs 2D tabular reports
    
    - line plots vs. tables
    
    - tables vs. graphs
    
    - stereoscopic scattergrams vs stereoscopic block diagrams
    
    - 2D graphs vs tabular displays, monocolor vs multicolor
    
- Problem-solving performance using graphical data is affected by the dimensionality of the graph, mode of presentation, and background of the user

- Solution times for computer graphs were faster than paper graphs; 3D computer graphs were less difficult to use than paper presentation of 2D and 3D

- Solutions times were slower for 3D than 2D, but 3D computer graphs on computer had most effective answers

[Reading Bar Graphs: Effects of Extraneous Depth Cues and Graphical Contex](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/faculty/bt2158/faculty-profile/files/argraphs_Effectsofdepthcuesandgraphicalcontext.pdf)

- 3D less accurate, but neighboring graphical elements also affected judgement

[When Higher Bars Are Not Larger Quantities: On Individual Differences in the Use of Spatial Information in Graph Comprehension](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13875868.2012.659302)

- Tendency to make errors when spatial features and other information conflict

- People rely on spatial-to-conceptual mappings

- This tendency was stronger for individuals with low graph literacy
