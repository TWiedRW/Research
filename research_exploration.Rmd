# Research Topics

- Perception of 3D printed graphs

- Create extension of `ggplot2`

- Recreate old census graphics

- Perception of map projections

# Perception of 3D Printed Graphs

[Tactile Heatmaps: A Novel Visualisation Technique for Data Analysis with Tactile Charts](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3453892.3458045)

- Pilot study (11 participants)

- Participants preferred 3D printed heatmaps over alternative material/plots

- Elevation and texture combinations were suggested

- Metrics about preference instead of error metrics

[User Study: A Detailed View on the Effectiveness and Design of Tactile Charts](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-29381-9_5)

- Larger study (37 participants)

- Bar chart, line chart, scatter plots

- Readability and accuracy
